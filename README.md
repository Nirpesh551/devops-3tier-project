# 3-Tier DevOps Portfolio Project

A production-like **3-tier web application** built with modern DevOps practices to demonstrate skills in containerization, CI/CD, monitoring, and security.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Nginx serving static web content
- **Backend**: Node.js REST API (Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- All services containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- Security: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy in CI/CD
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated build, test, scan, and deploy

## Features
- Fully containerized multi-tier application
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Observability with metrics and dashboards
- DevSecOps integration
- Clean, reproducible setup
